Changes only in Hortonworks github and not in Apache Spark release 1.4.1 and hence not covered by CHANGES.txt.

NEW FEATURES

     SPARK-1537: Add integration with Yarn's Application Timeline Server
     SPARK-6112: Provide external block store support through HDFS RAM_DISK

BUG FIXES
     SPARK-10623: NoSuchElementException thrown when ORC predicate push-down is turned on
     SPARK-19970: Table owner should be USER instead of PRINCIPAL in kerberized clusters

IMPROVEMENTS
     1. Atomatically add azure support (including azure related jar in classpath)
     2. Support accessing hive metastore in both yarn-client and yarn-cluster mode in kerberos cluster. 
     But it does not support accessing different version of hive metastore, and spark.sql.hive.metastore.version
     is not valid.
